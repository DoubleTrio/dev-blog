This week, I have been taking the time to understand how Audaspace is integrated into Blender's VSE. The most important files are `blenkernel/intern/sound.cc` and its header file `blenkernel/BKE_sound.h`. I will taking a little look at specifically animating sound properties (eg. volume and pitch) which `@iss` or Richard Antalik describes in the following [thread](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2025-draft-pitch-correction-for-sound-playback-in-sequencer/39752). 


## Playing Audio

When you press `Spacebar` to play an audio clip in the sequencer, the `BKE_sound_play_scene` function is called, which makes several calls to the Audaspace library below.

<details> 
  <summary>Code</summary>



  ```{cpp}

  // Called by `wmOperatorStatus ED_screen_animation_play(bContext *C, int sync, int mode)` in `screen_cops.cc`
  void BKE_sound_play_scene(Scene *scene)
  {
    std::lock_guard lock(g_state.sound_device_mutex);
    sound_device_use_begin();
    sound_verify_evaluated_id(&scene->id);

    AUD_Status status;
    const double cur_time = get_cur_time(scene);

    AUD_Device_lock(g_state.sound_device);

    if (scene->sound_scrub_handle &&
        AUD_Handle_getStatus(scene->sound_scrub_handle) != AUD_STATUS_INVALID)
    {
      /* If the audio scrub handle is playing back, stop to make sure it is not active.
      * Otherwise, it will trigger a callback that will stop audio playback. */
      AUD_Handle_stop(scene->sound_scrub_handle);
      scene->sound_scrub_handle = nullptr;
      /* The scrub_handle started playback with playback_handle, stop it so we can
      * properly restart it. */
      AUD_Handle_pause(scene->playback_handle);
    }

    status = scene->playback_handle ? AUD_Handle_getStatus(scene->playback_handle) :
                                      AUD_STATUS_INVALID;

    if (status == AUD_STATUS_INVALID) {
      sound_start_play_scene(scene);

      if (!scene->playback_handle) {
        AUD_Device_unlock(g_state.sound_device);
        return;
      }
    }

    if (status != AUD_STATUS_PLAYING) {
      /* Seeking the synchronizer will also seek the playback handle.
      * Even if we don't have A/V sync on, keep the synchronizer and handle seek time in sync. */
      AUD_seekSynchronizer(cur_time);
      AUD_Handle_setPosition(scene->playback_handle, cur_time);
      AUD_Handle_resume(scene->playback_handle);
    }

    if (scene->audio.flag & AUDIO_SYNC) {
      AUD_playSynchronizer();
    }

    AUD_Device_unlock(g_state.sound_device);
  }
  ```
</details> 

## Animating Audio

There are currently 5 properties of audio that can be animated in Audiospace shown below:


<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
AnimateableProperty* SequenceEntry::getAnimProperty(AnimateablePropertyType type)
{
	switch(type)
	{
	case AP_VOLUME:
		return &m_volume;
	case AP_PITCH:
		return &m_pitch;
	case AP_PANNING:
		return &m_panning;
	case AP_LOCATION:
		return &m_location;
	case AP_ORIENTATION:
		return &m_orientation;
	default:
		return nullptr;
	}
}
```
</details> 

We'll be looking at in particular how the **volume** and **pitch** is animated in Blender's VSE.


## Volume 

### **(CAUTION: VOLUME WARNING)**

::: {#fig-my-video fig-alt="Clip of adjusting the volume "}
{{< video volume_example.mp4 >}}
:::


<!-- ![Volume](volume_property.png) -->

The RNA for the volume property is defined `rna_sequencer.cc` in the function `rna_def_audio_options`



<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
static void rna_def_audio_options(StructRNA *srna)
{
  PropertyRNA *prop;

  prop = RNA_def_property(srna, "volume", PROP_FLOAT, PROP_NONE);
  RNA_def_property_float_sdna(prop, nullptr, "volume");
  RNA_def_property_range(prop, 0.0f, 100.0f);
  RNA_def_property_float_default(prop, 1.0f);
  RNA_def_property_ui_text(prop, "Volume", "Playback volume of the sound");
  RNA_def_property_translation_context(prop, BLT_I18NCONTEXT_ID_SOUND);
  RNA_def_property_update(prop, NC_SCENE | ND_SEQUENCER, "rna_Strip_audio_update");
}
```
</details> 

And the UI for the volume (or the sound properties) is defined in `space_sequencer.py`
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
...
def draw(self, context):
        layout = self.layout

        st = context.space_data
        overlay_settings = st.timeline_overlay
        strip = context.active_strip
        sound = strip.sound

        layout.active = not strip.mute

        if sound is not None:
            layout.use_property_split = True
            col = layout.column()

            split = col.split(factor=0.4)
            split.alignment = 'RIGHT'
            split.label(text="Volume", text_ctxt=i18n_contexts.id_sound)
            split.prop(strip, "volume", text="")

            layout.use_property_split = False
        ...

```



When we scrub the **volume** property, the function `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame` is called.
For example below, sliding the **volume** to 1.4...

![](volume1.png){fig-alt="Volume property in Blender's video sequencer"}


leads to the breakpoint in `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame`. 


![](volumecode1.png){fig-alt="Breakpoint at BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame example"}


The `frame` variable corresponds to the location of the playhead at 2 seconds (60 frames) and 29 frames, so **(60 + 29 = 89 frames)**. The `handle` variable is a pointer to Audaspace's `AUD_SequenceEntry` class, which stores the  variables such as **volume** and **pitch** for a sound sequence as shown below in Audaspace's `SequenceEntry.h`.


<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
	/// The animated volume.
	AnimateableProperty m_volume;

	/// The animated panning.
	AnimateableProperty m_panning;

	/// The animated pitch.
	AnimateableProperty m_pitch;

	/// The animated location.
	AnimateableProperty m_location;

	/// The animated orientation.
	AnimateableProperty m_orientation;
```

</details> 

The `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame` function just only makes a call to `AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData` as shown below:

<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
void BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame(void *handle,
                                               const int frame,
                                               float volume,
                                               const char animated)
{
  AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData(handle, AUD_AP_VOLUME, frame, &volume, animated);
}
```
</details> 


The function `AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData` in `AUD_Sequence.cpp` looks like the following:

<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
AUD_API void AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData(AUD_SequenceEntry* entry, AUD_AnimateablePropertyType type, int frame, float* data, char animated)
{
	AnimateableProperty* prop = (*entry)->getAnimProperty(static_cast<AnimateablePropertyType>(type));
	if(animated)
	{
		if(frame >= 0)
			prop->write(data, frame, 1);
	}
	else
	{
		prop->write(data);
	}
}

```
</details> 


And finally, below is the call stack for `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame`


<details> 
<summary>Call Stack</summary>

```
Blender!BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame(void*, int, float, char) (blender/source/blender/blenkernel/intern/sound.cc:1029)

```
</details> 

The important thing to note above is that `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame` is called by the function `strip_update_sound_properties` in `sequencer.cc`. In a future blog, I'll likely discuss about the `animated` parameter in `AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData` and have a demo program to test out, as currently, I'm not exactly sure what it does and haven't investigated thoroughly yet!

## Pitch 

This GSOC project will primarily focus on the sound property of pitch for implementing pitch correction. In Blender, pitch is primarily affected by retiming keys, which allows you to change the playback speed of video/audio clips. However, this has the consequence of increasing the pitch when the playback speed is increased or decreasing the pitch when the playback speed is decreased. Below is an example of using retiming keys to increase the playback audio speed. 

![](retiming_key.png){fig-alt="Example of using retiming keys to increase the audio playback speed by 2.27x"}


First, the code relevant to the drawing the retiming keys onto the audio strip can be found in `sequencer_retiming_draw.cc` but I haven't had the time look into, but I believe it is not currently not too relevant for this project.


Now, one of the relevant function related to the functionality of the retiming keys (and therefore pitch!) is `retiming_sound_animation_data_set` in `strip_retiming.cc` which is declared as the following:



<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
void retiming_sound_animation_data_set(const Scene *scene, const Strip *strip)
{
  /* Content cut off by `anim_startofs` is as if it does not exist for sequencer. But Audaspace
   * seeking relies on having animation buffer initialized for whole sequence. */
  if (strip->anim_startofs > 0) {
    const int strip_start = time_start_frame_get(strip);
    BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_constant_range(
        strip->scene_sound, strip_start - strip->anim_startofs, strip_start, 1.0f);
  }

  const float scene_fps = float(scene->r.frs_sec) / float(scene->r.frs_sec_base);
  const int sound_offset = time_get_rounded_sound_offset(strip, scene_fps);

  RetimingRangeData retiming_data = strip_retiming_range_data_get(scene, strip);
  for (int i = 0; i < retiming_data.ranges.size(); i++) {
    RetimingRange range = retiming_data.ranges[i];
    if (range.type == TRANSITION) {

      const int range_length = range.end - range.start;
      for (int i = 0; i <= range_length; i++) {
        const int frame = range.start + i;
        BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_at_frame(
            strip->scene_sound, frame + sound_offset, range.speed_table[i], true);
      }
    }
    else {
      BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_constant_range(
          strip->scene_sound, range.start + sound_offset, range.end + sound_offset, range.speed);
    }
  }
}

```
</details>

The code above loops over retiming key ranges (which is stored in the `RetimingRange` class and contains variables like the `start` and `end` frame, the playbeed `speed`, as well as it type which is defined as an enumerator below in `strip_retiming.cc`)


```{c++}
enum eRangeType {
  LINEAR = 0,
  TRANSITION = 1,
};
```

Additionally, `retiming_sound_animation_data_set` makes a call to two different pitch functions `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_at_frame` and `BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_constant_range` depending on whether the range is `LINEAR` or `TRANSITION` and is defined as below in `sound.cc`:

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
void BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_at_frame(void *handle,
                                              const int frame,
                                              float pitch,
                                              const char animated)
{
  AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData(handle, AUD_AP_PITCH, frame, &pitch, animated);
}

void BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_constant_range(void *handle,
                                                    int frame_start,
                                                    int frame_end,
                                                    float pitch)
{
  frame_start = max_ii(0, frame_start);
  frame_end = max_ii(0, frame_end);
  AUD_SequenceEntry_setConstantRangeAnimationData(
      handle, AUD_AP_PITCH, frame_start, frame_end, &pitch);
}
```

</details> 

Below is an example of the two range types:

![](retiming_range_types.png){fig-alt="Different range types: TRANSITION and LINEAR"}

where the `TRANSITION` range is represented by the retiming keys with **77% -  116%** in between while the retiming keys with **77%** or **116%** represents a `LINEAR` range. In the example image above, the `TRANSITION` range interpolates between the **77%** and **116%** playback speed from the 00:23-00:36 range. Codewise, `RetimingRange` stores the interpolated values from **77% -  116%** inside a vector `speed_table` which is set for which is set for each frame within the `TRANSITION` range. 

Meanwhile, the `LINEAR` ranges (00:00-00:23 and 00:36-01:10) maintains a constant playback speed (and thus the same constant pitch for that particular playback speed).


Here's an example audio clip which contains both the RetimingRanges type!

{{< video retiming_audio_example.mp4 >}}

## Next Steps

- In the upcoming weeks, I will probably play around with the `AUD_SequenceEntry` class in an isolated environment to get a better sense of how it works and also mess around with the different `AnimateableProperty`s. - I currently have the Rubberband Library built as a static library in a separate, local fork, and make it public for code review this or next week. I will need to take the time to understand Audaspace's `Effect` and `EffectReader` class by looking at the many, many examples and see if I can do something with the `Rubberband Library` there
- I also need to finish up writing the post about compiling the `Rubberband Library`, how to use it, and benchmarking it to make sure it is suitable and usable for Audaspace/Blender
- I can probably start adding some of the UI code for the Pitch Correction toggle
- There's also a PR from a couple weeks that I should probably finish and has been dragging on for months now (whoops!)

## Questions

These were things I wasn't sure about Blender's codebase or where I can access the variable from the UI. If any maintainers or anyone more familiar with the codebase could answer for me, that would be great! 


#### Question #1
For this line in `sequencer.cc`
```
BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_volume_at_frame(strip->scene_sound, frame, strip->volume, (strip->flag & SEQ_AUDIO_VOLUME_ANIMATED) != 0);
```

where can the strip flag be toggled for having animated volume in Blender

#### Question #2

For `AUD_SequenceEntry_setAnimationData` function what exactly does the `animated` parameter do? I didn't have time to look into further this week.



#### Question #3

For defining the Pitch Correction toggle, should it something be added to `DNA_sequence_types.h`

<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
enum {
  /* `SELECT = (1 << 0)` */
  SEQ_LEFTSEL = (1 << 1),

  /* Access scene strips directly (like a meta-strip). */
  SEQ_SCENE_STRIPS = (1 << 30),

  SEQ_INVALID_EFFECT = (1u << 31),
};
```

</details> 


#### Question #4

For the operator types below, what editor has these operators in Blender?
<details> 
<summary>Code</summary>

```{c++}
void ED_operatortypes_sound()
{
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_open);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_open_mono);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_mixdown);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_pack);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_unpack);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_update_animation_flags);
  WM_operatortype_append(SOUND_OT_bake_animation);
}
```

</details> 

## Random Thoughts

- I learned a lot of things during the community bonding week and this first week from things like compiling/making a blog to learning a little bit about CMAKE files and how to read them, and to using the debugger in VSCode more efficiently!
- I hope these notes were somewhat useful or insightful to anyone looking to understand a bit about Blender's VSE! I know these notes will be useful for me down the line as I start to implement the pitch correction toggle, and I will have more questions down the line! This post took way longer to write than I initially thought, but I really enjoyed taking the time to understand and explain a portion of Blender's VSE.






<!-- This is not animated... -->



<!-- If we have a transition like below


`range.speed_table[i]`

`BKE_sound_set_scene_sound_pitch_at_frame(strip->scene_sound, frame + sound_offset, range.speed_table[i], true);`
    
you plenty of examples of how effects are implemented. You can then put
this new effect on any other Sound (e.g. an audio file). Assuming you
want to make the time stretching/pitch scaling animatable, the factor
should be an AnimateableProperty that the IReader then reads from. The
AnimatableProperty is currently used only in the Sequencer classes.
